    "issue": "When pip is installing and extracting a maliciously crafted wheel archive, files may be extracted outside the installation directory. The path traversal is limited to prefixes of the installation directory, thus isn't able to inject or overwrite executable files in typical situations.",
    "impact": "[MEDIUM] Malicious wheel archives can extract files outside installation directory via path traversal.",
    "fix": "Fix: Validate the path prefix against the installation directory before extraction."

    "issue": "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in google.protobuf.json_format.ParseDict() in Python, where the max_recursion_depth limit can be bypassed when parsing nested google.protobuf.Any messages.  Due to missing recursion depth accounting inside the internal Any-handling logic, an attacker can supply deeply nested Any structures that bypass the intended recursion limit, eventually exhausting Python\u2019s recursion stack and causing a RecursionError.",
