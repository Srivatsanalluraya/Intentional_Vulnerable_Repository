    "issue": "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in google.protobuf.json_format.ParseDict() in Python, where the max_recursion_depth limit can be bypassed when parsing nested google.protobuf.Any messages.  Due to missing recursion depth accounting inside the internal Any-handling logic, an attacker can supply deeply nested Any structures that bypass the intended recursion limit, eventually exhausting Python\u2019s recursion stack and causing a RecursionError.",
    "impact": "[MEDIUM] A DoS vulnerability allows bypassing max_recursion_depth, enabling a potential denial-of-service attack.",
    "fix": "**Fix:** Set `max_recursion_depth` to a lower value when calling `ParseDict()`, e.g., `json_format.ParseDict(data, message, recursion_limit=10)`."
